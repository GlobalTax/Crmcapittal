# This is a placeholder for notification sounds
# In a real implementation, you would place actual audio files here:
# - critical.mp3 (for critical notifications)
# - important.mp3 (for important notifications) 
# - info.mp3 (for informational notifications)
# - success.mp3 (for success notifications)

# For now, the system will gracefully handle missing sound files
